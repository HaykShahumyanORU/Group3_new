#### Basic Functions

**sum**
=sum(cell:cell)

#### Using the x,Census Data 

#### Description 
It is a census of the poverty levels in California in the year of 2018 

#### Format 

This data has 63 rows and 4 columns.
[1] Label -> categorical
[2]population estimate ->  numerical
[3]below poverty population estimate -> numerical
[4]percent below poverty -> percentage

#3 details 
Label - categorizing of population by different variables i.e age, ethnicity, race and sex
population estimate - calculation of total population by categories under label
below poverty population estimate- calculation of total population below poverty levels  below poverty by categories under label
percentage - calculation of percent of total population divided by total population below poverty

#### Cleaning
I removed the ratios as it only had the total popualtion seperated by age which was just a reiteration of the first few rows 

there was an option of including the marginal error and I chose against that. I did not believe it was 
vital in explaining my data.

#### Explanation
This data is has 71 rows, which divides my data into groups that are in the category of age, sex,
race,highest level of education,employment status, work experience,and UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM POVERTY STATUS IS DETERMINED

This data is has 4 columns that are filled with label and three estimate, each estimate is separated into the total
in the group identified in the row and the amount that is below poverty as well as the percentage of the amount below poverty compared to the total in the category highlighted in the rows.

The above are the visualizations I chose to do to explain my data.
The first is the distribution of poverty levels by gender to get a better understanding of the poverty levels in each gender before we break it up even further 

The second is by age and I chose to include the overall population of each age group to understand the poverty levels against the overall population

I also then made a pivot table chart with the education levels which makes the chart interchangeable and I can single out each education levels poverty rate

The 4th is among ethnicity if I continue using this data set the poverty among ethnicity is very important to understand and I also used a pie chart because it was the easiest to see which ethnicity has the most and compare them against one another.

Total homeless population against the total population just helps understand the overall populations of both before the deep dive 

Lastly i just did the poverty levels against age without the total population because I believe age is the best way to describe the poverty levels.

## Week 2

#### Histograms

I am using the air quality dataset, which is a measurement in New york from the months
May to September 1973

#### Format 
this data has 153 observation and 6 variables but after cleaning it has 112 observations and six variables

#### Source 
I got this data from d2l which was obtained from the New York State Department Of conservation

I use excel to clean the data, remove all the NA which I used the filter tab to achieve. 

![](Histogram.png)
![](Config.png)
This explains the average of ozone,solar,wind and temp pver the months which gives us a good idea of of which month was the highest and which had the stongest pull through the months.


![](Config1.png)

I chose maximum winds by the months and day to see their trend lind and which month 
going into specifically what day had the highest and lowest.



![](AvgTemp.png)
I also did the average ozone by temp whichb gives an idea of what was happening in
the ozone by different temps


## Week 3

### Wednesday

Puromycin was my data set which is the study of the reaction verus the substrate concentration in an enzymatic reaction involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme treated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.

This dataset has 23 rows and 3 columns


conc -> a numeric vector of substrate concentrations (parts per million-ppm)

rate/velocity  -> a numeric vector of instantaneous reaction rates, which was calculated from conc (counts/min/min)

state -> a factor with levels treated untreated

### Friday

-Shae plans to work on a dashboard based on poverty data for specifically the state of oklahoma between Friday and Saturday-

#### Using the x,Census Data 

#### Description 
It is a census of the poverty levels in Oklahoma in the year of 2023 

#### Format 

This data has 6 fields and 69 rows
[1] Label -> categorical
[2]population estimate ->  numerical
[3]below poverty population estimate -> numerical
[4]percent below poverty -> percentage

#3 details 
Label - categorizing of population by different variables i.e age, ethnicity, race and sex
population estimate - calculation of total population by categories under label
below poverty population estimate- calculation of total population below poverty levels  below poverty by categories under label
percentage - calculation of percent of total population divided by total population below poverty

Source 
<https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S1701?q=poverty%20in%20oklahoma%20in%202023>

#### Cleaning

Upon putting my data into Tableu I had to change all my numerical data into numerical from categorical.
