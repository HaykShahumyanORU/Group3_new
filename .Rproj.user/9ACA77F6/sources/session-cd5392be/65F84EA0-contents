Excel

### Wednesday

### Basic Functions

I can now use sum, average, and more functions to select a whole row and make the process more efficient for large datasets.

### Basic Visualizations

Through using the insert tab, I learned how to choose to represent data with a scatterplot, line plot, bar chart, and more. To customize and format the histogram is easily done in Excel. Each axis can be labeled for the person viewing to understand.

### Scatter Plot

From the Dataset, we see a trend that as the age of the tree increases, the circumference also increases. This is consistent for different types of trees and helps us see into history of how long a tree survived. Another method is also to count the rings once the tree is cut down. However, using the circumference gives a qualitative measurement of when the tree can still be alive and aged.

### Friday

The US Bureau of Labor and Statistics offers many data sets to do with the work force in America. This data is found from civilian unemployment rates over the past 10 years including people of different ethnicity.

The visualization shows there is a peak in unemployment rate in the year 2020-2021 when Covid-19 affected everyday lives of civilians. This graph represents the unemployment dramatic decrease during the pandemic, but also stabilization in 2022.
