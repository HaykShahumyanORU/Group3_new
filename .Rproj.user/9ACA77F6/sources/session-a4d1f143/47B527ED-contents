## Week 1

Excel

### Wednesday

I spent about 30 mins to an hour working through the VIZ_basic-excel-web excel practice page and did everything until the homework tab which requires me to do a different data set. So all steps 1 through 6 including all the basic functions, how to filter out tools that were not necessary, how to adjust inputted graphs and visualizations, and how to add in all the different visualizations were completed.


since this was my first time learning how to use quarto after finishing all the excel practices from Monday, I have not explained each individual tool I practiced since I have completed them all already.

### Friday


Today I have chosen my data set. My data set has a large collection of data, which holds data of modeled medium and heavy duty vehicle with info on their stock, sales, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and total cost of driving. I have chosen to do vehicle sales as my dataset for today. Chatgpt recommends these areas for the inserts 1. Total Vehicle Sales by Year and Vehicle Class

    Graph Type: Stacked Bar Chart
    Purpose: This will show how the sales of different vehicle classes contribute to the total sales each year, and how the sales have changed over the years.
    X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026)
    Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands)
    Stacked Bars: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)

2. Trend of Vehicle Sales by Vehicle Class Over Time

    Graph Type: Line Chart
    Purpose: To visualize the trend of sales for each vehicle class over the years.
    X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026)
    Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands)
    Lines: Separate lines for Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), and Heavy (Classes 7-8)

3. Yearly Distribution of Vehicle Sales Across Classes

    Graph Type: Pie Charts (for each year)
    Purpose: To show the percentage share of each vehicle class in total sales for each year.
    Slices: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)

4. Comparison of Vehicle Sales Growth Between Classes

    Graph Type: Grouped Bar Chart
    Purpose: To compare how much each vehicle class has grown or declined in sales from year to year.
    X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026)
    Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands)
    Bars: Separate bars for Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), and Heavy (Classes 7-8), grouped by year.

5. Sales Proportion Change Over Years for Each Vehicle Class

    Graph Type: 100% Stacked Area Chart
    Purpose: To show how the proportion of sales for each vehicle class has changed over the years.
    X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026)
    Y-axis: Percentage of Total Sales (%)
    Areas: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)

Recommended Chart: Total Vehicle Sales by Year and Vehicle Class (Stacked Bar Chart)

This chart provides a clear visual comparison of vehicle sales over the years and how each class contributes to the total sales.

## Week 2

### Wednesday

#### Histogram

I am using the airquality dataset, which is ...


I use excel to clean the data, remove all the rows which have NA values, and I did an exploration analysis

#### Ozone Histogram

### friday

Today I am learning about pivot charts which are extended from pivot tables. To get to my insert chart I selected all of my pivot table and near the insert tab there was an option for a pivot chart.

![](Screenshot 2024-09-06 144851.png)


This graph shows how for each day for each month, the ratio of each value. For example, for each month you can start to see the temperature changes between each day within each month. You can see which days have more average Ozone, and which days have an increase of solar Radiation. We can see how when there is an increase in temperature, there is less solar radiation which I find interesting. there was a day on the 8th month where there seemed to be no solar radiation and only an increased average temp and increased ozone.

This pivot table and pivot chart for my data is representing how much of the market is taken up by which type of vehicles. We can see visually that generally, there is a trend that the shorter the distance for the commercial vehicles, the more of those types of vehicles are bought. My data for this week is the vehicle stock. The X line represents how much vehicles are sold, while the Y line lists the amount of miles expected for that commercial vehicle type. 


## Week 3

### Wednesday

A data frame with 20 observations on 3 variables.

[, 1]	extra	numeric	increase in hours of sleep
[, 2]	group	factor	drug given
[, 3]	ID	factor	patient ID

Using the sleep dataset to create my first dashboard

<https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hayk.shahumyan/viz/Wednesdayweek3/Dashboard1>

### Friday

I plan to work on fuel costs of vehicles of projected till 2040

Format

There are 3 variables we focus on:
cost of electricity
cost of diesel
cost of hydrogen 
from now till 2050

Details

We can see trends of downward prices of electricity and hydrogen, while diesel is mostly stable in price

## Week 4

### Wednesday and Friday

## This is a markdown title ##

in markdown we can create lists:

- Item 1
- item 2
- item 3

also we can create enumerated list

1. Hola
2. Hi
3. Namaste

we can do **bold**, also *italic*




```python
# Here we are importing numpy with a nickname np
import numpy as np
print(np.absolute(-1))
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

    1
    [1 2 3 4 5]
    


```python
#List are native to python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list)

```

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    


```python
# We will be using a lot of dataframes, so we need pandas library
import pandas as pd
data = {'Ozone': [41, 36, 12], 'Temp': [67, 72, 74]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

       Ozone  Temp
    0     41    67
    1     36    72
    2     12    74
    

## 4. Loading csv Files

To load .csv files into a `DataFrame`, we use the pandas function
`read_csv`:


```python
df = pd.read_csv('airquality_datasets.csv')
```


```python
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 153 entries, 0 to 152
    Data columns (total 6 columns):
     #   Column   Non-Null Count  Dtype

## 5. visualizing the dataset
Let’s dive into visualizations using matplotlib. We’ll start with simple histograms and boxplots, then move on to correlation plots.
Histograms

Histograms help us understand the distribution of the variables. We’ll create histograms for Ozone and Temp.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Ozone Histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(df['Ozone'].dropna(), bins=20, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Ozone Levels')
plt.xlabel('Ozone (ppb)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

```

```python

# Temp Histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(df['Temp'].dropna(), bins=20, color='orange', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Temperature')
plt.xlabel('Temperature (°F)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

## Week 5




![](HaykWeek5.png)

## Week after fall break

(For this weeks assignment, everyone needed to find a dataset from our datasource and give a summary about it.)

https://www.bls.gov/wsp/overview.htm

The data provides a historical record of annual work stoppages in the U.S. involving 1,000 or more workers, starting from 1947. It includes the following key information:

    The year of the work stoppage.
    The number of work stoppages that began in a given year and those still in effect.
    The number of workers involved (in thousands).
    The number of days of idleness (in thousands) caused by these stoppages.
    The percentage of total working time lost due to these stoppages.

This dataset is focused on capturing the frequency and economic impact of large-scale labor disruptions over time.


direct summary from the website:

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has two types of data about work stoppages: Work Stoppages program data and the Strike Report.

The Work Stoppages program provides monthly and annual data of major work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers lasting one full shift or longer. The monthly and annual data show the establishment and union(s) involved in the work stoppage along with the location, the number of workers and the days of idleness. The monthly data list all work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers that occurred during the full calendar month for each month of the year. The annualized data provide statistics, analysis and details of each work stoppage of 1,000 or more workers that occurred during the year. The work stoppages data are gathered from public news sources, such as newspapers and the Internet. The BLS does not distinguish between strikes and lock-outs in the data; both are included in the term "work stoppages".
