## WEDNESDAY

Puromycin was my data set which is the study of the reaction verus the substrate concentration in an enzymatic reaction involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme treated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.

This dataset has 23 rows and 3 columns


conc -> a numeric vector of substrate concentrations (parts per million-ppm)

rate/velocity  -> a numeric vector of instantaneous reaction rates, which was calculated from conc (counts/min/min)

state -> a factor with levels treated untreated
