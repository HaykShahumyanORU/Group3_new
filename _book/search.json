    "text": "1.1.1 Wednesday\nI spent about 30 mins to an hour working through the VIZ_basic-excel-web excel practice page and did everything until the homework tab which requires me to do a different data set. So all steps 1 through 6 including all the basic functions, how to filter out tools that were not necessary, how to adjust inputted graphs and visualizations, and how to add in all the different visualizations were completed.\nsince this was my first time learning how to use quarto after finishing all the excel practices from Monday, I have not explained each individual tool I practiced since I have completed them all already.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Friday\nToday I have chosen my data set. My data set has a large collection of data, which holds data of modeled medium and heavy duty vehicle with info on their stock, sales, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and total cost of driving. I have chosen to do vehicle sales as my dataset for today. Chatgpt recommends these areas for the inserts 1. Total Vehicle Sales by Year and Vehicle Class\nGraph Type: Stacked Bar Chart\nPurpose: This will show how the sales of different vehicle classes contribute to the total sales each year, and how the sales have changed over the years.\nX-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026)\nY-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands)\nStacked Bars: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)\n\nTrend of Vehicle Sales by Vehicle Class Over Time\nGraph Type: Line Chart Purpose: To visualize the trend of sales for each vehicle class over the years. X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands) Lines: Separate lines for Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), and Heavy (Classes 7-8)\nYearly Distribution of Vehicle Sales Across Classes\nGraph Type: Pie Charts (for each year) Purpose: To show the percentage share of each vehicle class in total sales for each year. Slices: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)\nComparison of Vehicle Sales Growth Between Classes\nGraph Type: Grouped Bar Chart Purpose: To compare how much each vehicle class has grown or declined in sales from year to year. X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands) Bars: Separate bars for Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), and Heavy (Classes 7-8), grouped by year.\nSales Proportion Change Over Years for Each Vehicle Class\nGraph Type: 100% Stacked Area Chart Purpose: To show how the proportion of sales for each vehicle class has changed over the years. X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) Y-axis: Percentage of Total Sales (%) Areas: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)\n\nRecommended Chart: Total Vehicle Sales by Year and Vehicle Class (Stacked Bar Chart)\nThis chart provides a clear visual comparison of vehicle sales over the years and how each class contributes to the total sales.\n\nthis graph shows us that the light-medium vehicles are the ones that were sold the most from the large amount of data",

To customize and format the histogram is easily done in Excel. Each axis can be labeled for the person viewing to understand.\n\n\n2.1.4 Scatter Plot\n\nFrom the Dataset, we see a trend that as the age of the tree increases, the circumference also increases. This is consistent for different types of trees and helps us see into history of how long a tree survived. Another method is also to count the rings once the tree is cut down. However, using the circumference gives a qualitative measurement of when the tree can still be alive and aged.\n\n\n2.1.5 Friday\nThe US Bureau of Labor and Statistics offers many data sets to do with the work force in America. This data is found from civilian unemployment rates over the past 10 years including people of different ethnicity.\n\nThe visualization shows there is a peak in unemployment rate in the year 2020-2021 when Covid-19 affected everyday lives of civilians. This graph represents the unemployment dramatic decrease during the pandemic, but also stabilization in 2022.",

The first is the distribution of poverty levels by gender to get a better understaning of the poverty levels in each gender before we break it up even further\nThe second is by age and I chosse to include the overall population of each age group to understand the poverty levels against the overall population\nI also then made a pivot table chart with the education levels which makes the chart interchangeable and I can single out each education levels poverty rate\nThe 4th is among ethnicity if I continue using this data set the poverty among ethnicity is very important to understand and I also used a pie chart because it was the easiest to see which ethnicity has the most and compare them against one another.\nTotal homeless population against the total population just helps understand the overall populations of both before the deep dive\nLastly i just did the poverty levels against age without the total population because I believe age is the best way to describe the poverty levels.",
