    "text": "1.1.1 Wednesday\nI spent about 30 mins to an hour working through the VIZ_basic-excel-web excel practice page and did everything until the homework tab which requires me to do a different data set. So all steps 1 through 6 including all the basic functions, how to filter out tools that were not necessary, how to adjust inputted graphs and visualizations, and how to add in all the different visualizations were completed.\nsince this was my first time learning how to use quarto after finishing all the excel practices from Monday, I have not explained each individual tool I practiced since I have completed them all already.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Friday\nToday I have chosen my data set. My data set has a large collection of data, which holds data of modeled medium and heavy duty vehicle with info on their stock, sales, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and total cost of driving. I have chosen to do vehicle sales as my dataset for today. Chatgpt recommends these areas for the inserts 1. Total Vehicle Sales by Year and Vehicle Class\nGraph Type: Stacked Bar Chart\nPurpose: This will show how the sales of different vehicle classes contribute to the total sales each year, and how the sales have changed over the years.\nX-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026)\nY-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands)\nStacked Bars: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)\n\nTrend of Vehicle Sales by Vehicle Class Over Time\nGraph Type: Line Chart Purpose: To visualize the trend of sales for each vehicle class over the years. X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands) Lines: Separate lines for Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), and Heavy (Classes 7-8)\nYearly Distribution of Vehicle Sales Across Classes\nGraph Type: Pie Charts (for each year) Purpose: To show the percentage share of each vehicle class in total sales for each year. Slices: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)\nComparison of Vehicle Sales Growth Between Classes\nGraph Type: Grouped Bar Chart Purpose: To compare how much each vehicle class has grown or declined in sales from year to year. X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) Y-axis: Vehicle Sales (in thousands) Bars: Separate bars for Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), and Heavy (Classes 7-8), grouped by year.\nSales Proportion Change Over Years for Each Vehicle Class\nGraph Type: 100% Stacked Area Chart Purpose: To show how the proportion of sales for each vehicle class has changed over the years. X-axis: Year (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) Y-axis: Percentage of Total Sales (%) Areas: Light-Medium (Class 3), Medium (Classes 4-6), Heavy (Classes 7-8)\n\nRecommended Chart: Total Vehicle Sales by Year and Vehicle Class (Stacked Bar Chart)\nThis chart provides a clear visual comparison of vehicle sales over the years and how each class contributes to the total sales.\n\nthis graph shows us that the light-medium vehicles are the ones that were sold the most from the large amount of data",

To get to my insert chart I selected all of my pivot table and near the insert tab there was an option for a pivot chart.\n\nThis graph shows how for each day for each month, the ratio of each value. For example, for each month you can start to see the temperature changes between each day within each month. You can see which days have more average Ozone, and which days have an increase of solar Radiation. We can see how when there is an increase in temperature, there is less solar radiation which I find interesting. there was a day on the 8th month where there seemed to be no solar radiation and only an increased average temp and increased ozone.\n\nThis pivot table and pivot chart for my data is representing how much of the market is taken up by which type of vehicles. We can see visually that generally, there is a trend that the shorter the distance for the commercial vehicles, the more of those types of vehicles are bought. My data for this week is the vehicle stock. The X line represents how much vehicles are sold, while the Y line lists the amount of miles expected for that commercial vehicle type.",

To customize and format the histogram is easily done in Excel. Each axis can be labeled for the person viewing to understand.\n\n\n2.1.4 Scatter Plot\n\nFrom the Dataset, we see a trend that as the age of the tree increases, the circumference also increases. This is consistent for different types of trees and helps us see into history of how long a tree survived. Another method is also to count the rings once the tree is cut down. However, using the circumference gives a qualitative measurement of when the tree can still be alive and aged.\n\n\n2.1.5 Friday\nThe US Bureau of Labor and Statistics offers many data sets to do with the work force in America.

The CE includes two types of surveys: the Interview Survey and the Diary Survey. The Interview Survey gathers information about significant or ongoing expenses that people can remember over a period of 3 months or more, including large purchases like homes and cars or regular payments like rent and utilities.\nCE data are valuable for both government and private organizations that focus on specific population groups, including the elderly, low-income families, urban residents, and individuals receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Economic policymakers use this data to evaluate how policy changes affect living standards among various socioeconomic groups, while econometricians leverage it to build models for predicting economic outcomes.\nI plan to break up all the parts of the data to the main sections to compare how much consumers spend on each category in life.",
