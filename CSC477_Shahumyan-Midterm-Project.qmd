This visualization helps discuss the main focus of my datasource which is all about energy efficiency and energy consumption. The specific dataset im using which is from this datasource, is all about efficiency relating to mid to heavy duty vehicles projected from 2020-2050

## 1. Data Access and Collection Methods

-   **Source Overview:**\
    The dataset analyzed for this project, titled *"Assessing Total Cost of Driving Competitiveness of Zero-Emission Trucks"*, was obtained from the **NREL Data Catalog**, which is publicly accessible at [NREL Data Catalog](https://data.nrel.gov/). This repository ensures that federally funded data related to clean energy technologies is made available to the public.

-   **File Formats and Access:**\
    The dataset is available in Excel format, providing organized sheets with data on vehicle sales, energy consumption, maintenance costs, and total cost of driving. You can download the file directly from the NREL platform.

-   **Data Acquisition Procedure:**\
    To access the data, you would navigate to the NREL Data Catalog, select the relevant dataset, and download the file in Excel format. The dataset is freely available, and no special permissions or logins are required.

## 2. Data Variables and Contextual Framework

-   **Variables and Definitions:**\
    Key variables include:

    -   **Vehicle Class**: Defines the weight category of the vehicle (e.g., Light-Medium, Medium, Heavy).

    -   **Technology**: Represents the type of vehicle technology (e.g., EV, FCEV, HEV, ICEV).

    -   **Maintenance Cost (\$/Mile)**: The cost to maintain the vehicle per mile driven.

    -   **TCD (\$/Mile)**: The total cost of driving, including fuel, maintenance, and other costs.

-   **Data Collection Purpose:**\
    This dataset was collected to support analyses of the cost competitiveness of zero-emission trucks compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Key stakeholders include policymakers, researchers, and manufacturers, who use this data to assess the economic viability of cleaner vehicle technologies.

-   **Contextual Significance:**\
    The data helps address questions related to environmental sustainability, cost efficiency, and the transition to zero-emission technologies in the medium and heavy-duty vehicle markets. These insights are crucial for shaping transportation policy and achieving long-term emission reduction goals.

## 3. Analytical Approach and Visualization Techniques

-   **Analytical Methods:**\
    Data was preprocessed by filtering vehicle classes and technologies to compare their maintenance and total driving costs. Maintenance cost per mile and total cost per mile were the primary focus of analysis. I would notice which areas of data could make an important impact on daily life for the average person and any company. A big primary focus would be which points would affect the cost of things, as in how much money could be saved or lost.

-   **Visualization Techniques:**\
    Two primary visualizations were created:

    -   **Maintenance Cost by Vehicle Class and Technology**\
        A bar chart was used to compare the maintenance cost per mile for various vehicle technologies and classes. This visualization helps highlight how electric vehicles generally have lower maintenance costs compared to ICEV and HEV technologies.

-   **Key Observations:**\

    Electric vehicles (e.g., EV-150, EV-300) consistently demonstrate lower maintenance costs than traditional vehicles, while heavy-duty vehicles incur the highest maintenance costs regardless of technology.

    This second visualization source is just another form of viewing the same data from above but from another perspective if you find the above unappealing

This last visualization for this report shows the quantity of each vehicle type, including the direction of each vehicle type from 2020-2050

## 4. Insights Derived from Data Analysis

-   **Key Findings:**\
    The data reveals that electric vehicles (EVs) are not only environmentally friendly but also economically advantageous in terms of maintenance costs. HEV and ICEV technologies tend to have higher maintenance costs, especially in heavier vehicle classes.

    Electric vehicles are directed to scale up in quantity by 2050 while regular fuel type vehicles are projected to go down significantly while still holding a large margine in quantity.

-   **Contextual Interpretation:**\
    These findings suggest that transitioning to electric trucks could yield significant cost savings for fleet operators, especially in the long term, as maintenance costs are a major contributor to overall operational expenses.

    The clear reason for why electric vehicles are directed to go up is because we are currently in a direction in society where people want to go green and stop burning fossil fuels, wanting to only use clean energy.

## 5. Discussion of Data Quality and Limitations

-   **Data Integrity:**\
    The dataset appears comprehensive and well-structured, though further analysis could benefit from more granular data, especially at the regional level.

-   **Limitations of Analysis:**\
    Some vehicle classes and technologies may lack sufficient data points, which can skew the analysis. Additionally, the dataset is national in scope, meaning regional variations in fuel and maintenance costs are not considered.

-   **Potential Improvements:**\
    More detailed data on regional maintenance costs and energy consumption patterns would enhance the quality of the analysis. Future research could incorporate temporal data to study how these costs evolve over time.

## 6. Conclusions and Implications for Future Research

-- Summary

-   **Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Maintenance Costs**: EVs demonstrate significantly lower maintenance costs across various vehicle classes, particularly in light and medium-duty categories. The simplicity of their drivetrains, which lack many of the components found in internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), contributes to these cost reductions.

-   **Total Cost of Driving (TCD)**: While the upfront cost of electric vehicles may still be higher, their overall total cost of driving (TCD), which includes maintenance, fuel, and other operational costs, is competitive, especially in light-duty categories. In medium-duty vehicles, EVs continue to show cost advantages, whereas heavy-duty vehicles face higher costs, indicating a need for further technological advancements.

-   **Technology Comparison**: Among various vehicle technologies, **hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)** and **fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs)** tend to show higher costs compared to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), largely due to their increased maintenance requirements and less efficient fuel use in some contexts.

-- Broader Implications

-   **Fleet Operations**: The significant reduction in maintenance costs for EVs makes them a strong candidate for fleet adoption, especially in light-duty and medium-duty categories. For companies and government fleets, shifting to EVs could lead to long-term operational savings, reduced downtime, and higher overall efficiency. This is especially relevant for urban transport and logistics, where range limitations are less of a concern.

-   **Environmental and Policy Impact**: The findings strongly support the transition to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), particularly in industries where operational costs are tightly managed. Lower TCD for electric vehicles, combined with their environmental benefits, may drive policy incentives, including subsidies and regulatory pushes for EV adoption, which will help achieve broader climate goals.

-   **Challenges in Heavy-Duty Segments**: Despite the cost advantages in lighter vehicles, the higher total costs of heavy-duty electric trucks highlight ongoing challenges, particularly related to battery capacity and range. Future innovations in **battery technology** and **charging infrastructure** are necessary to make EVs competitive in the heavy-duty market, where they currently lag behind ICEVs in cost-efficiency.

-   **Industry and Market Trends**: The broader implications of this shift suggest that manufacturers and policymakers should continue investing in **charging infrastructure** and **battery advancements** to reduce costs further and improve EV feasibility across all vehicle classes.
