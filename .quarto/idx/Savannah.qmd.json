The Ozone data was measured from Roosevelt Island, the Solar Radiation data was measured from Central Park, and the both the Wind and Temperature data was measured from the LaGuardia airport. This data was obtained from the New York State Department of Conservation, which provided the Ozone data, as well as the National Weather Service, which provided the meteorological data including the temperature, wind, and solar radiation values.\n\nI used excel to clean the data by removing all the rows with NA values, and performed exploration analysis with histograms and a pivot table and chart.\n\n#### Ozone Histogram \n**In-class example**\n\n![](hist_ozone.png)\n\n#### Ozonve vs Temp Scatter Plot\n**In-class example**\n\n![](scatter_ozone_temp.png)\n\n#### My first Pivot Table and Chart\n\n![](airquality_my_pivot.png)\n\nFrom my pivot table, I was able to take all the numerical data from the airquality data set and use a stacked line chart to compare the values of Ozone, Solar Radiation, Wind, and Temperature per day in the month of May. The line chart is colored by topic to make it easy to visually compare each topic as it changes per day. From this visualization, I was able to observe that the Wind and Temperature values remained relatively even throughout the month, while the Solar Radiation values became occasionally unstable, and the Ozone values changed drastically throughout the month.\n\n\n\n\n\n#### INDIVIDUAL PROJECT DOCUMENTATION\n\nMy data set is **Rates of COVID-19 Cases or Deaths by Age Group and Vaccination Status** from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website**.\n\n#### Description of data set\n\nThis data set was posted on October 21, 2022 and was revised on February 22, 2023. The data reflect cases among people within various age groups with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among people within those age groups with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022.\n\nThe data was provided by the CDC COVID-19 Response, Epidemiology Task Force.\n\nThis data set has 1,591 rows and 16 columns.\n\n#### Purpose of data set\n\nThis information can be used by the CDC and pharmaceutical companies to see how affective the vaccine is in preventing Covid-19 cases, as well as to see if the vaccine helps prevent death once the virus is contracted.\n\nThis information can also be used to see if the vaccine is more correlated to preventing deaths or cases within specific age groups.\n\nThis information can be used by hospitals to predict the necessary number of beds and ventilators needed for patients.\n\nThis information can be used by insurance companies to determine how much money should be put aside to cover health/life insurance costs.\n\n#### Variables in data set and data type\n\n**OUTCOME:** case or death (text)\n\n**MONTH:** corresponding month to the MMWR week- MMM YYYY (text)\n\n**MMWR week:** the morbidity and mortality weekly report- YYYYWW (text)\n\n**AGE GROUP:** 0-5 (4 yrs), 5-11, 12-17, 18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65-70, 80+ (text)\n\n**VACCINE PRODUCT:** Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer, all (text)\n\n**VACCINATED WITH OUTCOME:** weekly count of vaccinated individuals that correspond with an outcome (number)\n\n**FULLY VACCINATED POPULATION:** cumulative weekly count of the population vaccinated (number)\n\n**UNVACCINATED WITH OUTCOME:** weekly count of unvaccinated individuals that correspond with an outcome (number)\n\n**UNVACCINATED POPULATION:** cumulative weekly count of the population un-vaccinated (number)\n\n**CRUDE VAX IR:** incident rate for vaccinated population **per 100,000** (number)\n\n**CRUDE UNVAX IR:** incident rate for un-vaccinated population **per 100,000** (number)\n\n**CRUDE IRR:** incident rate ratio (un-vaccinated : vaccinated) (number)\n\n**AGE ADJUSTED VAX IR:** incident rate by age for vaccinated population **per 100,000** (number)\n\n**AGE ADJUSTED UNVAX IR:** incident rate by age for un-vaccinated population **per 100,000** (number)\n\n**AGE ADJUSTED CRUDE IRR:** incident rate ratio by age (un-vaccinated : vaccinated) (number)\n\n**CONTINUITY CORRECTION:** indicates whether the data was adjusted with the assumption that at least 5 percent of the population in the jurisdiction is un-vaccinated (number) \n\n#### Link
