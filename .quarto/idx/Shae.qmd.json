I did not believe it was \nvital in explaining my data.\n\n## Explanation\nThis data is has 71 rows, which divides my data into groups that are in the category of age, sex,\nrace,highest level of education,employment status, work experience,and UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM POVERTY STATUS IS DETERMINED\n\nThis data is has 4 columns that are filled with label and three estimate, each estimate is separated into the total\nin the group identified in the row and the amount that is below poverty as well as the percentage of the amount below poverty compared to the total in the category highlighted in the rows.\n\n![](Plots1.png)\n![](Plots2.png)\nThe above are the visualizations I chose to do to explain my data.\nThe first is the distribution of poverty levels by gender to get a better understaning of the poverty levels in each gender before we break it up even further \n\nThe second is by age and I chosse to include the overall population of each age group to understand the poverty levels against the overall population\n\nI also then made a pivot table chart with the education levels which makes the chart interchangeable and I can single out each education levels poverty rate\n\nThe 4th is among ethnicity if I continue using this data set the poverty among ethnicity is very important to understand and I also used a pie chart because it was the easiest to see which ethnicity has the most and compare them against one another.\n\nTotal homeless population against the total population just helps understand the overall populations of both before the deep dive \n\nLastly i just did the poverty levels against age without the total population because I believe age is the best way to describe the poverty levels.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"Shae.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
