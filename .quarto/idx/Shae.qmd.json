I did not believe it was \nvital in explaining my data.\n\n#### Explanation\nThis data is has 71 rows, which divides my data into groups that are in the category of age, sex,\nrace,highest level of education,employment status, work experience,and UNRELATED INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM POVERTY STATUS IS DETERMINED\n\nThis data is has 4 columns that are filled with label and three estimate, each estimate is separated into the total\nin the group identified in the row and the amount that is below poverty as well as the percentage of the amount below poverty compared to the total in the category highlighted in the rows.\n\n![](Plots1.png)\n![](Plots2.png)\nThe above are the visualizations I chose to do to explain my data.\nThe first is the distribution of poverty levels by gender to get a better understanding of the poverty levels in each gender before we break it up even further \n\nThe second is by age and I chose to include the overall population of each age group to understand the poverty levels against the overall population\n\nI also then made a pivot table chart with the education levels which makes the chart interchangeable and I can single out each education levels poverty rate\n\nThe 4th is among ethnicity if I continue using this data set the poverty among ethnicity is very important to understand and I also used a pie chart because it was the easiest to see which ethnicity has the most and compare them against one another.\n\nTotal homeless population against the total population just helps understand the overall populations of both before the deep dive \n\nLastly i just did the poverty levels against age without the total population because I believe age is the best way to describe the poverty levels.\n\n## Week 2\n\n#### Histograms\n\nI am using the air quality dataset, which is a measurement in New york from the months\nMay to September 1973\n\n#### Format \nthis data has 153 observation and 6 variables but after cleaning it has 112 observations and six variables\n\n#### Source \nI got this data from d2l which was obtained from the New York State Department Of conservation\n\nI use excel to clean the data, remove all the NA which I used the filter tab to achieve. \n\n![](Histogram.png)\n![](Config.png)\nThis explains the average of ozone,solar,wind and temp pver the months which gives us a good idea of of which month was the highest and which had the stongest pull through the months.\n\n\n![](Config1.png)\n\nI chose maximum winds by the months and day to see their trend lind and which month \ngoing into specifically what day had the highest and lowest.\n\n\n\n![](AvgTemp.png)\nI also did the average ozone by temp whichb gives an idea of what was happening in\nthe ozone by different temps\n\n\n## Week 3\n\n### Wednesday\n\nPuromycin was my data set which is the study of the reaction verus the substrate concentration in an enzymatic reaction involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme treated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.\n\nThis dataset has 23 rows and 3 columns\n\n\nconc -> a numeric vector of substrate concentrations (parts per million-ppm)\n\nrate/velocity  -> a numeric vector of instantaneous reaction rates, which was calculated from conc (counts/min/min)\n\nstate -> a factor with levels treated untreated\n\n\n<https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Week_3_Tableu_Mukurazhizha/Dashboard1#1>\n\n### Friday\n\n-Shae plans to work on a dashboard based on poverty data for specifically the state of oklahoma between Friday and Saturday-\n\n#### Using the x,Census Data \n\n#### Description \nIt is a census of the poverty levels in Oklahoma in the year of 2023 \n\n#### Format \n\nThis data has 6 fields and 69 rows\n[1] Label -> categorical\n[2]population estimate ->  numerical\n[3]below poverty population estimate -> numerical\n[4]percent below poverty -> percentage\n\n#3 details \nLabel - categorizing of population by different variables i.e age, ethnicity, race and sex\npopulation estimate - calculation of total population by categories under label\nbelow poverty population estimate- calculation of total population below poverty levels  below poverty by categories under label\npercentage - calculation of percent of total population divided by total population below poverty\n\nSource \n<https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S1701?q=poverty%20in%20oklahoma%20in%202023>\n\n#### Cleaning\n\nUpon putting my data into Tableu I had to change all my numerical data into numerical from categorical.\n\n\nDashboard Links\n<https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Ok_2023/Dashboard1#2>\n\n#### Explanation\n\n\n## Week 4\n\n### Wednesday and Friday\n\n```python\nimport
